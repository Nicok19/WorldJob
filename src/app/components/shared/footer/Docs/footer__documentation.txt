1. Footer:
    This component returns a footer element that contains a list of links and a subscription message. The links are mapped from the 'row.items' array and each link is wrapped in a 'li' element. The 'key' prop of each 'li' element is set to the index of the item in the 'row.items' array. The 'href' prop of each Link component is set to 'item.link' and the children of each Link component is set to 'item.name'. The subscription message is a 'h3' element that encourages users to subscribe to the newsletter for the latest updates and offers.

Please note that the 'row.items' array is not defined in the provided code excerpt. It is assumed that this array is passed as a prop to the Footer component or is defined elsewhere in the Footer component.
