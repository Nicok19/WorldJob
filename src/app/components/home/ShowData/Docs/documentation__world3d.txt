world3d.tsx

This file defines two React components that use the @react-three/fiber library to create a 3D representation of a world.

Imports:
- React, useRef from 'react': Used to create React components and to access DOM element references.
- Canvas, useFrame from '@react-three/fiber': Used to create a 3D canvas and to update the canvas on each animation frame.
- OrbitControls, Sphere from '@react-three/drei': Used to control the camera on the 3D canvas and to create a 3D sphere.
- TextureLoader from 'three': Used to load textures onto the 3D sphere.
- * as THREE from 'three': Used to access all exports from the 'three' library.
- './3d.css': A CSS file is imported for styling the components.

Components:

1. WorldSphere:
    This component creates a 3D sphere with a world texture. The texture is loaded from the 'world_texture.jpg' file using TextureLoader. The sphere is created with a radius of 3 and 32 width and height segments. The texture is applied to the sphere using meshPhysicalMaterial.

2. World:
    This is the main component that will be exported and used elsewhere in the application. Currently, this component returns nothing.
